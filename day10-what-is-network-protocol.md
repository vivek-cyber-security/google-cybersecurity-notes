# What is a Network Protocol

A network protocol is a set of rules
that helps devices communicate with
each other on a network.

When one device sends data to another,
both devices must follow the same rules.
These rules are called network protocols.

Protocols decide how data is sent,
received, and understood between devices.

## Why Network Protocols are Important

Without protocols, computers would not
be able to communicate properly.

Protocols help ensure that data is:
- Sent to the correct device
- Received in the correct format
- Delivered safely and securely

## Common Network Protocols

### 1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
HTTP is used to transfer web pages
from a server to a web browser.

It is not secure because data is
sent in plain text.

### 2. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.
It encrypts the data to protect
user information.

Most modern websites use HTTPS
to keep communication safe.

### 3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
FTP is used to transfer files
between computers over a network.

It is commonly used to upload
and download files from servers.

## Protocols and Cybersecurity

In cybersecurity, protocols are
important because attackers often
target weak or insecure protocols.

Understanding protocols helps
security professionals protect data
and secure network communication.
