# Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance

Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. A security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards. Security frameworks, controls, and compliance regulations work together to manage security and ensure everyone plays their part in minimizing risk.

## How Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance Are Related

### CIA Triad

The Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad is a model that helps organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

- **Confidentiality** – Ensures that data is accessed only by authorized users  
- **Integrity** – Ensures that data remains accurate and trustworthy  
- **Availability** – Ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed  

These three principles are foundational for cybersecurity professionals when selecting appropriate security controls to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

## Security Controls

- Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks  
- They are implemented alongside frameworks to:
  - Achieve security objectives
  - Ensure security processes are correctly followed
  - Meet regulatory and legal compliance requirements

---

## Security Frameworks

Security frameworks are guidelines used to build and maintain cybersecurity programs. They help organizations manage risks and protect data and privacy.

### Core Components of Security Frameworks

- Identifying and documenting security goals  
- Setting guidelines to achieve security goals  
- Implementing strong security processes  
- Monitoring and communicating results  

---

## Compliance

- Compliance is the process of following internal policies and external regulations  
- Higher compliance alignment generally results in lower risk  
- Compliance requirements vary by industry, organization, and region  

---

## Key Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance Standards
