## Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance

Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. A **security lifecycle** is a continuously evolving set of policies, standards, and processes used to protect organizational assets.

This document explains how **security controls**, **frameworks**, and **compliance regulations (laws)** work together to minimize cybersecurity risk and ensure accountability across an organization.

## How Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance Are Related

### CIA Triad

The **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad** is a foundational cybersecurity model used to evaluate and manage risk.

- **Confidentiality** – Ensures that data is accessed only by authorized individuals
- **Integrity** – Ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered
- **Availability** – Ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed

These three principles guide cybersecurity professionals in designing and implementing effective security controls.

---

## Security Controls

- Security controls are **safeguards** designed to reduce specific security risks
- Controls are implemented to protect against threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks
- Controls work alongside frameworks to ensure:
  - Security goals are met
  - Processes are correctly implemented
  - Regulatory requirements are satisfied

---

## Security Frameworks

Security frameworks are **guidelines** used to design and manage cybersecurity programs. They help organizations systematically reduce risk and protect data.

### Core Components of Security Frameworks

- Identifying and documenting security goals
- Establishing guidelines to achieve those goals
- Implementing strong security processes
- Monitoring performance and communicating results

---

## Compliance

- Compliance is the process of adhering to **internal standards** and **external regulations**
- Higher compliance alignment generally results in **lower organizational risk**
- Compliance requirements vary depending on industry, geography, and organization type
