# CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is a basic cybersecurity model used to protect information.

## Confidentiality
Confidentiality means information should only be accessed by authorized users.

## Integrity
Integrity means information should not be changed without permission.

## Availability
Availability means systems and data should be available when needed.

## Real Life Example
In an ATM system:
- Confidentiality protects your PIN
- Integrity ensures balance is correct
- Availability allows you to withdraw money anytime
