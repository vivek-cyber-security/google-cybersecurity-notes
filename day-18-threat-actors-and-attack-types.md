## Day 17 – Threat Actors and Types of Attacks

## Understanding Threat Actors

- A threat actor is any person or group that creates a security risk
- They may attack systems, networks or data
- Their actions can damage organizations and individuals
- Understanding their motivation helps in preventing attacks

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

- APTs are highly skilled and organized attackers
- They target large companies or government organizations
- They research the target before attacking
- They can stay hidden for a long time

- Their goals may include:
  - Damaging critical infrastructure
  - Stealing intellectual property
  - Accessing trade secrets
  - Espionage activities

## Insider Threats

- Insider threats are people inside the organization
- They already have authorized access
- They misuse their access for harmful purposes

- Their motivations include:
  - Sabotage
  - Corruption
  - Espionage
  - Data leaks

## Hacktivists

- Hacktivists are politically motivated attackers
- They use hacking for social or political reasons

- Their goals may include:
  - Social change campaigns
  - Demonstrations
  - Spreading propaganda
  - Gaining fame

## Types of Hackers

- A hacker is a person who uses technical skills to access systems

- Authorized hackers (Ethical hackers)
  - Follow laws and ethical guidelines
  - Help organizations find vulnerabilities
  - Work to improve security

- Semi-authorized hackers (Researchers)
  - Find vulnerabilities
  - Do not exploit them
  - Often report findings

- Unauthorized hackers (Unethical hackers)
  - Break the law
  - Steal confidential data
  - Sell data for money

## Other Threat Actors

- Beginners who want to learn hacking
- People seeking revenge
- Criminal groups working for money
- Contract hackers hired for specific tasks
- Vigilante hackers who believe they are protecting others

## Key Difference

- Threat actors are defined by malicious intent
- Hackers are defined by their technical skills and motivation

## Attack Types

- Cyber attacks can be simple or complex
- They fall under different security domains
- Understanding attack type helps in risk management

## Password Attacks

- Used to gain access to password protected systems
- Common types include:
  - Brute force attack
  - Rainbow table attack
- These attacks target authentication systems

## Social Engineering Attacks

- Manipulate people instead of systems
- Exploit human mistakes

- Common types include:
  - Phishing
  - Smishing
  - Vishing
  - Spear phishing
  - Whaling
  - Social media phishing
  - Business Email Compromise (BEC)
  - Watering hole attack
  - USB baiting
  - Physical social engineering

## Physical Attacks

- Target physical and digital systems
- Examples include:
  - Malicious USB cable
  - Malicious flash drive
  - Card cloning
  - Card skimming

## Adversarial Artificial Intelligence

- Uses AI and machine learning to improve attacks
- Manipulates AI systems
- Makes attacks more efficient and advanced

## Supply Chain Attacks

- Target third-party vendors or software providers
- Attack happens during product development or delivery
- Can affect multiple organizations
- Very costly and dangerous

## Cryptographic Attacks

- Target secure communication systems
- Attempt to break encryption

- Examples include:
  - Birthday attack
  - Collision attack
  - Downgrade attack

## Importance of CISSP Security Domains

- Help organize security responsibilities
- Help manage and reduce risk
- Help prepare for data breaches
- Each attack may fall under one or more domains

## What I Learned Today

- Different threat actors have different motivations
- Insider threats are very dangerous
- Social engineering attacks exploit human error
- Supply chain attacks can affect many organizations
- Understanding attack types helps in better defense
- Security is both technical and human-focused
