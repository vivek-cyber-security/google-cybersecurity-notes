## Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance

Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. A **security lifecycle** is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards. Security frameworks, controls, and compliance regulations work together to manage security and minimize organizational risk.

## How Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance Are Related

### CIA Triad

The **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad** helps organizations consider risk when designing systems and security policies.

- **Confidentiality** – Ensures only authorized access to data
- **Integrity** – Ensures data accuracy and trustworthiness
- **Availability** – Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed

These principles guide cybersecurity professionals in selecting appropriate controls to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

## Security Controls

- Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks
- Implemented alongside frameworks to:
  - Achieve security goals
  - Ensure correct security processes
  - Meet regulatory compliance requirements

---

## Security Frameworks

Security frameworks are guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and protect data and privacy.

### Core Components

- Identifying and documenting security goals
- Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
- Implementing strong security processes
- Monitoring and communicating results

---

## Compliance

- The process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations
- Higher compliance alignment generally leads to lower risk
- Requirements vary by industry, organization type, and geography
