# What is an IP Address

An IP address is a unique number given to
every device connected to a computer network.

IP address helps devices identify each other
and communicate on a network or the internet.
Without an IP address, data cannot reach
the correct destination.

## Types of IP Addresses

There are two main types of IP addresses.

### 1. IPv4
IPv4 is the older version of IP addressing.
It uses numbers separated by dots.
Example: 192.168.1.1

IPv4 is still widely used, but the number
of available IPv4 addresses is limited.

### 2. IPv6
IPv6 is the newer version of IP addressing.
It uses letters and numbers and provides
a very large number of addresses.

IPv6 was created to solve the shortage
of IPv4 addresses and improve security
and performance.

## Public and Private IP Address

A public IP address is used on the internet
and is provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).

A private IP address is used inside a local
network like home or office networks.

## Importance of IP Address in Cybersecurity

IP addresses are important in cybersecurity
because attackers and threats are often
identified using IP addresses.

Security professionals monitor IP addresses
to detect suspicious activities and protect networks.
