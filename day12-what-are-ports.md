# What are Ports in Networking

Ports are virtual points used by computers
to send and receive data over a network.

When data comes to a device, ports help
identify which application should receive
that data.

An IP address tells *which device* to send data to,
and a port number tells *which application*
should receive that data.

## Why Ports are Important

A computer can run many applications at the same time,
such as a web browser, email, and file transfer tools.

Ports help the system understand
where each type of data should go.

Without ports, data would get mixed up
and applications would not work correctly.

## Common Port Numbers

Some port numbers are commonly used
for specific services.

- Port 80 is used for HTTP
- Port 443 is used for HTTPS
- Port 21 is used for FTP
- Port 22 is used for SSH

These port numbers help networks
communicate in an organized way.

## Ports and Cybersecurity

Ports are very important in cybersecurity
because attackers often try to find
open or unsecured ports.

Security professionals monitor and manage ports
to block unauthorized access
and protect systems from attacks.

Understanding ports helps beginners
learn how network communication
and security controls work.
