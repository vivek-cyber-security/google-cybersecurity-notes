# Why Linux is Used in Cybersecurity

Linux is one of the most important operating systems
used in the cybersecurity field.

One major reason Linux is preferred is that it is open-source.
This allows security professionals to view, modify,
and understand how the system works internally.

Linux is known for its strong security model,
including user permissions and process control.
These features help prevent unauthorized access
and reduce security risks.

Most servers, cloud platforms, and cybersecurity tools
run on Linux. Because of this, learning Linux is essential
for anyone who wants to work in cybersecurity.

By learning Linux, beginners gain a deeper understanding
of system behavior, file structure, and security concepts,
which are critical for protecting systems and networks.
