# What is a Computer Network

A computer network means connecting two or more computers
or devices so that they can share data and information.

Networks help people communicate using the internet,
email, video calls, and messaging applications.

Connections in a network can be wired, like cables,
or wireless, like Wi-Fi and mobile networks.

The internet is the biggest example of a computer network
where millions of devices are connected worldwide.

In cybersecurity, computer networks are very important
because most attacks happen through networks.
Understanding networks helps in protecting data,
systems, and online communication.

As a beginner, learning networking basics is necessary
to understand how cyber attacks and defenses work.
