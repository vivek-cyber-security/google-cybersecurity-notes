# Network Devices

Network devices are hardware components
that help in connecting computers and
sending data from one device to another.

## 1. Router
A router connects different networks together.
It sends data from one network to another
using IP addresses.
Home Wi-Fi devices are common examples of routers.

## 2. Switch
A switch connects multiple devices inside
the same network.
It sends data only to the correct device,
which makes communication faster.
Switches are mostly used in offices and labs.

## 3. Hub
A hub is a simple network device.
It sends data to all connected devices
without checking the destination.
Because of this, hubs are less secure
and not commonly used today.

## 4. Modem
A modem connects a computer or router
to the internet.
It converts signals so that data can
travel over phone lines or fiber cables.

Understanding network devices is important
in cybersecurity because attackers often
target routers and switches to enter networks.
