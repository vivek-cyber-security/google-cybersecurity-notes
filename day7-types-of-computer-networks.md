# Types of Computer Networks

Computer networks are divided into different types
based on their size and area coverage.

## 1. LAN (Local Area Network)
LAN is used in small areas like homes, offices,
schools, or colleges.
It connects devices within a short distance.
Wi-Fi at home is an example of LAN.

## 2. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
MAN covers a larger area than LAN.
It is used in cities or large towns.
Cable TV networks in cities are an example of MAN.

## 3. WAN (Wide Area Network)
WAN covers very large areas like countries
or even the whole world.
The internet is the best example of a WAN.

## 4. PAN (Personal Area Network)
PAN is used for very small distances.
It connects personal devices like mobile phones,
earphones, smartwatches, and laptops.
Bluetooth connections are an example of PAN.

Learning these network types helps in understanding
how data travels and how cyber attacks spread
across different networks.
