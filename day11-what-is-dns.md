# What is DNS

DNS stands for Domain Name System.
DNS helps convert website names into
IP addresses that computers understand.

Humans remember website names like
google.com or amazon.com.
But computers communicate using
IP addresses.

DNS works like a phonebook.
When we type a website name in a browser,
DNS finds the correct IP address
and connects us to the website.

## How DNS Works (Simple Explanation)

1. A user enters a website name in the browser.
2. The request is sent to a DNS server.
3. The DNS server searches for the IP address.
4. The IP address is returned to the browser.
5. The browser connects to the website server.

## Why DNS is Important

DNS makes the internet easy to use.
Without DNS, users would need to
remember long IP addresses.

DNS also helps manage internet traffic
and ensures users reach the correct websites.

## DNS and Cybersecurity

DNS is important in cybersecurity
because attackers may use fake DNS
to redirect users to malicious websites.

Security professionals monitor DNS
activity to detect suspicious behavior
and protect users from cyber attacks.
